{"name":"uno-lan","tagline":"The UNO game for the network.","body":"There is a big fan-base for this popular family card-game. The success of the game on social networks like facebook ,encouraged me to start this as a project. Another reason was that I wanted to play this game on my college LAN ,without having to connect to the internet. The app on facebook is flash-based ,whereas the one that is being developed here is completely based on future-proof ,open-source technologies like PHP ,Ajax and HTML5/CSS3 .\r\n\r\nThe app is still under development . I invite developers to contribute to this project.\r\n\r\nThis is not an official UNO project ,supported by Mattel ,though I would want it to become one.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
