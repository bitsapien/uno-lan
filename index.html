        <p>There is a big fan-base for this popular family card-game. The success of the game on social networks like facebook ,encouraged me to start this as a project. Another reason was that I wanted to play this game on my college LAN ,without having to connect to the internet. The app on facebook is flash-based ,whereas the one that is being developed here is completely based on future-proof ,open-source technologies like PHP ,Ajax and HTML5/CSS3 .</p>

<p>The app is still under development . I invite developers to contribute to this project.</p>

<p>This is not an official UNO project ,supported by Mattel ,though I would want it to become one.</p>
